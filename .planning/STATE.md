## Key Context

- Discord channel ID was previously set to guild ID — corrected to #general (1487794996735377541)
- Bot re-authorized 2026-03-30 with Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History
- DRY_RUN=true, PAPER_TRADING=true in .env — safe defaults confirmed
- ETF scan live: `/scan_etf` command, `etf_watchlist.txt` (10 ETFs), ETF-aware analyst prompt
- All 9 blocking yfinance calls wrapped in asyncio.to_thread — gateway heartbeat safe

## Next Action

v1.2 started. Define REQUIREMENTS.md, then run `/gsd-plan-phase 9` to begin execution.
